# Watch my portfolio grow ðŸŒ±
I'm constantly working on updating and improving my portfolio website to showcase my latest projects and skills as a front-end developer. Whether it's experimenting with new design trends or implementing new frameworks and technologies, I'm always looking for ways to push the boundaries of what's possible with web design.
As part of this ongoing effort, I'm currently working on several new features for my portfolio website, including a more dynamic and interactive layout, improved project descriptions, and a more seamless user experience. I'm also exploring new ways to integrate my social media profiles and other online presences to give visitors a more complete picture of my skills and interests.
If you're interested in learning more about my portfolio or have any suggestions for how I can improve it, feel free to reach out to me at ðŸ“¬leslie.liwanen@gmail.com. I'm always open to feedback and collaboration! âœŠ
